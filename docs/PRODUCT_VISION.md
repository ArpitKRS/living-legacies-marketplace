# Afterlife — Product Vision & Philosophy

## Executive Summary

Afterlife is a digital marketplace that transforms the experience of buying and selling pre-owned items by centering **emotional storytelling** over transactional efficiency. Every product listing includes a rich history—visual timelines, attached memories, previous owner testimonials—turning second-hand shopping into an act of **inheriting meaning**.

## Core Philosophy

### "Objects Have Souls"

We believe that well-loved items absorb the essence of their owners. A chair isn't just furniture—it's sixty years of Sunday mornings. A typewriter isn't just a machine—it's a thousand love letters. Afterlife makes these invisible histories visible.

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional resale platforms treat pre-owned goods as commodities:
- **eBay/Craigslist**: Transactional, impersonal, price-focused
- **Etsy**: Aesthetic, but history is optional
- **Consignment stores**: Limited reach, no narrative layer

Buyers receive items with no context. Sellers let go of treasures without ensuring they'll be appreciated.

### Our Solution

Afterlife creates **emotional continuity** between owners:

1. **Story-First Listings**: Every item includes a timeline of its journey
2. **Memory Attachments**: Sellers share the moments associated with objects
3. **Visual Storytelling**: Animations reveal history as users scroll
4. **Custodian Mindset**: Buyers become "next chapter" owners, not just purchasers
